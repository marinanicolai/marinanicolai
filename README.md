# 👋🏼 Hi, I’m Marina!

🌊 I'm a passionate front-end developer who's on a mission to craft captivating digital experiences. 

Before diving into tech, I wore many hats in marketing, merchandising, and sales, where I refined my ability to connect with people and understand their needs. However, I yearned for a career that allowed me to channel my creativity and problem-solving skills into creating visually stunning and user-friendly web interfaces.

🌟 I'm truly excited about the front-end realm of tech and the endless possibilities it offers for enhancing user experiences and making the digital world more engaging.
